            I am interested in all things machine learning. I developed unsupervised learning 
            tools for understanding education customers at Microsoft. Previously, I built nlp 
            tools for text translation/classification at Locus Analytics. Currently pursuing 
            MS Data Science at U Washington. Actively pursuing full time employment in 
            NYC or Seattle.

           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
