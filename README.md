This is an example one-pager site that prospective job-seekers can use to quickly
highlight their accomplishments and make an introduction. It can be hosted for free using
GitHub Pages (as a Jekyll page).

This is based on a heavily pared-down version Jerome Lachaud's [Freelancer Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme).
Jerome's original theme is well-suited for designers to easily assemble a portfolio site of their visual work; this
is a prose-centric version tailored to software developers. [formspree](http://formspree.io/) is used for the contact form.

## Installation

On your command line do:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chuckgroom/onepage-bio.git
cd onepage-bio

# As mentioned in the main page of http://jekyllrb.com/
gem install bundler jekyll

# You may not need the following command
bundle update --bundler

# Following command builds the code and runs the local server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Using Docker

As alternative you can use docker to serve the page.
Use the following command to spin up the container using docker-compose.
The -d parameter is to run the container in the background.
``` sh
docker-compose up -d

# To rebuild the page use this command
docker-compose exec web jekyll b
```
